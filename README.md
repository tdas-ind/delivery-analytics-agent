Delivery Analytics Agent
An AI agent built on the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) that provides a conversational interface for analyzing delivery performance and payout data. This tool allows for intuitive, natural-language queries to retrieve insights, calculate compensation, and understand the logic behind complex business rules.

Overview
The agent processes two types of data: a dynamic dataset of delivery activities and a static set of business rules. This separation allows for flexible analysis of new data without needing to reconfigure the agent's core logic. The agent's intelligence is powered by an LLM that understands the user's intent, validates their requests, and provides transparent, step-by-step reasoning for its answers.

Key Features
Natural Language Interface: Interact with the agent using plain English to get detailed reports and calculations.

Payout Transparency: Get a clear breakdown of how bonuses and deductions are applied to a delivery person's total salary.

Performance Insights: Instantly analyze trends and identify top performers or average metrics across the entire delivery fleet.
